    We need to create and normalize 3 tables out of the csv data:
    Players, Openings, Games
    
    Define all three tables with explicit types, PRIMARY KEYs,
    FOREIGN KEYs, NOT NULL constraints, and CHECK constraints.

    Why explicit CREATE TABLE instead of letting to_sql() infer?
    - to_sql() creates columns with no constraints whatsoever
    - FK relationships would exist in comments only, not enforced
    - CHECK constraints (winner IN (...), turns >= 1) would be absent
    - NOT NULL would not be set on any column
    - Column types would be SQLite affinity guesses, not intentional choices

    Insertion order matters:
      players and openings must exist before games,
      because games has FK references to both.
